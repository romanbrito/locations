        <h1><span style="font-family: mrs-eaves">THE TEXADELPHIA STORY</span></h1>

        <h3>OUR HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h3>
        <p>When our founder, Joel Stanley, moved from Philadelphia PA to Austin in 1980, he brought his love of a great
            Philly cheesesteak, a local place where everyone is treated like family. With a grill and a dream, Joel
            served cheesesteaks with a Texas twist in the heart of Austin. He opened his first Texadelphia in Austin in
            1981 on “The Drag” (Guadalupe Street across from the
            University of Texas campus). From “Day One”, Texadelphia was a hit, first with UT students,
            but then with Austin residents across the city.</p>
        <h3>THE TEXADELPHIA DIFFERENCE: IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FOOD!</h3>
        <p>Soon after the first Texadelphia opened, the word spread of Texadelphia’s Cheesesteaks, Fresh Queso, and
            house-made
            Guacamole and amazingly addictive Mustard Blend. With a lot of hard work and the help of our fans, we’ve
            opened more
            restaurants with the same passion and commitment to food, our friends and a truly unique experience.</p>
        <p>We start with the highest quality, fresh ingredients. We make each and every cheesesteak to order and top it
            with a
            signature sauce of your choice. All of our cheesesteaks, burgers, salads and deli-sandwiches are served with
            complimentary tortilla chips and fresh salsa. It’s how our founder did it, it’s how we do it. It’s our
            passion.</p>
        <p>Today’s Texadelphia menu has grown from just one great cheesesteak… Our menu features a great variety of
            Original
            Texas Cheesesteaks for all tastes, scratch made Queso, Guacamole and Salsa as well as Signature Sauces that
            are made
            in-house every day. Other offerings include Burgers, Salads and Deli Sandwiches. All of our Cheesesteaks and
            sandwiches are served with tortilla chips and our scratch made salsa and can be topped with one of our
            signature
            sauces for free.</p>
        <p>But when it comes down to it, we do one thing better than anyone else. We are the home of the “Original Texas
            Cheesesteak.” It’s what we’ve been doing since 1981</p>
