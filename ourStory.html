                <h3>The Texadelphia Story</h3>
                <p>Texadelphia is the home of the “Original Texas Cheesesteak.” It’s what we’ve been doing since 1981.
                    <span class="medium-screen">When our founder moved to Austin from Pennsylvania in 1980, he brought
                    with him a desire to create and serve great food in a place where everyone is treated like family.
                    He brought with him his great love for  Philly’s favorite sandwich, but served it with
                    a Texas twist.</span>

                    <span class="large-screen"></br> Texadelphia first opened in 1981 in Austin, Texas.  After a few years,
                    Texadelphia restaurants began popping up all across Texas and even Oklahoma.</br>
                        <h3>The Texadelphia Difference</h3>We start with the highest quality,
                    fresh ingredients. We make each and every cheesesteak to order and top it with a signature sauce
                    of your choice. All of our cheesesteaks, burgers, salads and deli-sandwiches are served with
                    complimentary tortilla chips and fresh salsa. It’s how our founder did it, it’s how we do it.
                    It’s our passion.<br>
                    Texadelphia.  Inspired By Philly … Perfected in Texas!
